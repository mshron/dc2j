INFRASTRUCTURE
- figure out what to do with high-density coverage areas
X cron schedule: maybe putting in the lat/lons should kick off a PollDC now and then every 3 days?
- check for most recent letter?

INTERFACE
- write copy for index that includes the states where there is coverage and the % of all newspapers that are covered; point to friendsourcing bit; write a proper robots.txt to avoid having anything but the index page scraped
- get a proper header and title for the emails
- improve the formatting/coloring of sent emails
- prepare a text version of the html email, modify the API urls in model.py (do these nearly last)
- set most urls to admin only

LOGIC
- scrape school district (and add number completed to email)
- implement pixel tracking
- remove the #FIXME bits in the GAE, including the parts that simplified the dropbox lookup
- unsubscribe result page improvements
